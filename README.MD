# Haiku generator

## Build as a portfolio project in the Codeacademy Full stack engineer course

This is a small script to create a random haiku by seleciting from a prebuild list.

This project is made to learn how to use git more than JS.
It uses 3 arrays to store the 3 lines that a haiku needs and chooses randomly from each line to create the haiku.
